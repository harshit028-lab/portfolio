                        <h2>Three.js</h2>

                        <p>Three.js allows the creation of graphical processing unit (GPU)-accelerated 3D animations using the JavaScript language as part of a website without relying on proprietary browser plugins.[4][5] This is possible due to the advent of WebGL,[6] a low-level graphics API created specifically for the web.[7]

High-level libraries such as Three.js or GLGE, Scene.js, PhiloGL, and many more make it possible to author complex 3D computer animations for display in the browser without the effort required for a traditional standalone application or a plugin js is a cross-browser JavaScript library and application programming interface (API) used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser using WebGL. The source code is hosted in a repository on GitHub.
Three.js was first released by Ricardo Cabello on GitHub in April 2010.[2] The origins of the library can he code was originally developed in the ActionScript language used by Adobe Flash, later being ported to JavaScript in
While WebGL is a very powerful API for creating 3D graphics, it can be quite challenging to learn and use effectively. ......

                        <h2>Java</h2>

                        <p>Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle) in 1995. It is platform-independent, meaning code written in Java can run on any platform that supports Java without needing to be recompiled (the "Write Once, Run Anywhere" philosophy). This is achieved through the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which converts Java bytecode into machine code specific to the platform.Java is one of many high-level programming languages that use abstraction (reducing and factoring details) to create software for computers and many other electronic devices.  Compared to low-level programming languages, high-level programming languages use a mixture of natural language (any language used by humans) and typical computer terms to create an easier to understand and simpler form of programming.  Figures 1 and 2 show the difference in writing a simple program called “Hello World” in Assembly (a low-level programming language) and in Java.

                        <p>Graphic designers are creative professionals who use their artistic skills to create visual content for various mediums. They work on projects such as designing logos, brochures, websites, and advertisements.A graphic designer is a professional who practices the discipline of graphic design, either within companies or organizations or independently. They are professionals in design and visual communication, with their primary focus on transforming linguistic messages into graphic manifestations, whether tangible or intangible.[1][2] They are responsible for planning, designing, projecting, and conveying messages or ideas through visual communication.[3] Graphic design is one of the most in-demand professions with significant job opportunities, as it allows leveraging technological advancements and working online from anywhere in the world.[4]
